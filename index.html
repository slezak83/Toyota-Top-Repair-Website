							<STRONG>Tech Tip of The Day</STRONG>: When diagnosing a code like p0015 Camshaft 'B' over retarded, first perform an active test. 
							You should feel the engine attemt to stall if it moves. Note the cam angles for each cylinder, advanced or retarded at idle and 
							at 2000 rpm. Then make sure that you remove the union bolts at the valve cover that fasten and deliver oil 
							to the feed tube for the vvt-i system and pull out the filter inside first before replacing 
							the camshaft gear. Sometimes FIPG or other debris can lodge itself inside and inhibit the flow of oil to the vvt-i camshaft gears. Also 
							be sure to remove the first camshaft cap for related camshaft and make sure there are no scratches or has a dull/pitted 
							appearance. Camshafts can lose oil pressure this way also and cause this code, but this is a very rare case. <BR>&nbsp;<BR>
