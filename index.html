							<STRONG>Quick Tech Tip</STRONG>: The tacoma has been the source of numerous issues as we all know. The 2017 tacoma 
							has now been found to have good spots underneath the lower intake manifold for mice and rats. If you get a code for 
							an open circuit on one or more of the direct injection injectors (p020213 cylinder 2 for example) I strongly advise
							you to make sure there is a real open circuit or short, remove the upper intake and look for a mouse or rat that has 
							chewed through the sub harness very near the D4S connectors under the throttlebody.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>

								Sorry for the lack of updating the tech tips and repairs, I have not had much time.
								I have updated the "Quick Tip" section above and a torque converter
								shudder diagnosis in the "Toyota Diagnosis" section. Also updated "Tech Tips" for a misfire
								due to carbon issue as seen in the "new" 2016 yaris.
