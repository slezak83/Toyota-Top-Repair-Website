										Before raising vehicle all the way up, take a 19mm socket and air ratchet, 
										and remove the center bolt in the dog bone mount on the engine side of the mount, 
										at the top, front of the engine.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Remove the splash panelling underneath the rear part of the sub-frame if it has one.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Grab the impact gun and a 15mm impact socket and 17mm socket, Remove the bolts and 
										nuts underneath all three engine mounts that attach to the sub-frame.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Using one pole jack, raise pole jack underneath the transmission bellhousing and 
										lift powertrain assembly ¼”.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Remove the 19mm nuts for the transmission and engine mounts. On some Highlander and Sienna models or some lexus RX models, 
										remove the 12mm harmonic damper next to the 19mm nut on the transmission mount first and then the 19mm nut.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Raise engine off of the mount on the engine and take a dead blow hammer to hit the mount 
										in order to break tension loose on the mount from the bracket. *Take caution not to raise 
										too high or you will end up pulling the axles out of the inner joints. It’s very hard to 
										put them back into place, but if you do need to, pull and push on the axle shaft while 
										turning the wheel hub at the same time to put them back into place.*
									</Li>	
									<Li>
										Take the lower ball joints and turn them out of the way by taking bolts out of the lower control arms first, then turning the joints.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Next remove the 19mm nut and bolt in the rear of the control arm with a combination wrench and impact socket of the same size.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Take the 24 mm socket and impact gun and remove the 24 mm control arm bolts in the front mount of the lower control arm.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Remove the Control arm by prying on the rear bushing and pulling out on the rear part of the arm and pushing the lower ball 
										joint side down in order to clear the spindle and ball joint.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Move the washer from the lower control arm front bushing and place onto new arm as soon as you take off the control arm 
										so that you do not misplace it or reinstall it in the wrong place on the new control arm.
									</Li>	
									<Li>
										Carefully install the lower control arm rear bushing into sub-frame first.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Gently pull outward on spindle and turn control arm towards front of vehicle to line up the two 
										24 mm bolts holes in front control arm bushing over sub-frame.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Install front 24 mm bolt in lower control arm front bushing and then rear 24 mm bolt.
										Note: You may have to tap lightly on the head of the 24 mm bolts if they do not catch the threads correctly.
										Installing the front bolt first will make it easier to get the one towards the rear to line
										up with the threads. Make sure not to tighten all the way before loosely installing all bolts and nuts 
										into the lower control arm.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Tighten the 24mm bolts and then the 19mm bolt and nut with the impact gun and sockets.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Line up the lower ball joint bolts with control arm while holding the ball joint side of the lower control arm in the “Down” position.
										Note: If they do not line up, check to make sure you did not pull too far out on the axle inner joint by feeling the inner joint for a 
										round bearing sticking out of the axle inner joint housing, through the boot.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Tighten ball joint bolt and nuts with 17mm impact socket.
									</Li>
									<Li>
										Repeat for the other side and then install new axle nuts and reinstall the front wheels and you are done!
