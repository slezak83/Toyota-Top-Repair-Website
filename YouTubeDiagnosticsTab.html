									<p class="text">ScannerDanner diagnoses a restricted fuel injector problem with a chevy prizm however, it uses the 
									Toyota 1.8l 1zz-fe engine. This problem has been known to create a few problems such as code p0171 bank 1 lean.
									Watch how he diagnoses this problem and note the steps he takes and the data parameters he is using to diagnose.
									In any diagnosis of a low power concern, you need to make sure the engine produces: vacumm (which signals the exhaust
									is not restricted), has proper intake air volume measurement, ecm calculates vacumm properly and is checked with a vacumm
									gauge, ignition KV is at least 10KV across all cylinders, injector flow is even and valve timing is correct. Most of
									these checks will be checked in this order (least invasive to most invasive.)</p>

									<p class="text">This is an excellent approach to diagnostics by symptoms and duplicating the problem. He has a very sharp
									eye and gets down to the problems root in a different way than scannerdanner does, without all the fancy
									equipment. Some of this can be done on test drives with customers and in your service bays to get a jump-start
									on a diagnosis.</p>
