								2017 Tacoma D4S Injection Broken Wiring
							</h2>
							<hr>
								<blockquote>
									<IMG ID="D4S" src="images/D4S injector sub-harness LH.png"alt="Picture here of rats that chewed up wiring under throttlebody"></img>
								</blockquote>
								
								<blockquote>
									This Tacoma came in with multiple codes for a cylinder number two and cylinder six misfire on top of an open direct
									injection injector for number two and six. I then proceeded to the ecm to test the wiring and found the 
									wiring back to the injectors were open. Once I removed the upper intake plenum I found what confirmed exactly what had 
									happened. Mice had chewed up the wiring in the injector sub-harness underneath the intake plenum. (See image above and below) 
								</blockquote>
									<IMG CLASS="D4S1"src="images/D4S wiring.png" alt="picture of harness underneath intake showing broken wiring, had to remove intake to find it"></IMG>
									<IMG CLASS="D4S2"src="images/D4S close up.png" alt="close up picture showing three broken wires"></IMG>
								<blockquote class="text">
									If you are going to diagnose this fast I suggest to start from the GRAY and BLACK six pin
									connectors (six pins inside the connector but has room for 8 pins<strong>[gray]</strong> and 10 pins<strong>[black]</strong>) for the D4S system 
									directly underneath the throttlebody. If it's not open there, then obviously it's further back 
									to the ecm and if not, then probably you have a wiring issue or an injector issue. To get to the 
									ecm is difficult because it's located directly behind the glovebox.

								Restricted Fuel Injectors or Carbon?

									<blockquote>
										I really wished I had better information based upon personal experience.
										My experience with this problem started with p0171 on a 2az-fe engine, 
										but it was what I noticed in the techstream data that really got my attention. 
										When you use techstream create a custom data list (refresh rate is faster) 
										and select fuel trim data (short term and long term bank 1 and 2) and Mass Airflow.
										Hook up a fuel pressure gauge so that you do not miss low fuel pressure if it drops!
										Take a look below...
									</blockquote>	
										<br>
										<img class="Data1" src="images/clogged injectors before.png" alt="Fuel Injector Caused very positive fuel trim here"></img>
									<blockquote>
										The key here is that when this car was idling the fuel trim was steady at 7&percnt;
										long term and relatively low short term (near +/-zero). The fuel pressure stayed constant 
										at 47psi. I then put the car in drive with my foot on the brakes revved and 
										watched the MAF sensor shoot up to 47 grams/sec. The fuel trim seemed to become 
										erratic so I watched what happened on decel during fuel cut and did not notice 
										it getting very lean or misfiring. Usually during fuel cut during decel you 
										get misfiring from carbon build up or a valve not closing. If ignition was weak it wouldn't burn everything 
										and the exhaust stream would become rich and might misfire during acceleration.
										I revved to 2000 rpm and held it while watching the fuel trims and found that when I did 
										this, the long term went up to +21.00&percnt; and +15.00&percnt; short term.
										I knew now this could only be a fuel injection problem.
										Scroll down and look what happened after I replaced the fuel injectors.
									</blockquote>
									<br>
									<img class="Data2" src="images/clogged fuel injector after.png" alt="Fuel trim extremely negative to correct itself"></img>
									<blockquote>
										In the picture above you can see exactly what should happen when you have fixed
										the problem. In the picture above the short term fuel trim starts to over correct
										for the previous learned values for the lean condition. It now goes -18.00&percnt;
										on one bank and -14.88&percnt; on the other bank of this 2az-fe. 
										I have seen this two times since then on the same engine with the same symptoms.
										I am coming to the conclusion that this is a typical restricted fuel injector.
										So there you have it! If you find these symptoms after checking all the basics
										in your repair manual, then try this as one of your next tests. Beware that
										Siennas have been getting this lean code from a weak fuel pump. Don't try to 
										replace a set of six injectors if all you have is bad fuel pressure. CHECK THE BASICS FIRST!!!

							Torque Converter Shudder
						</h2>
						<hr>
						<blockquote>
							This shudder happened in a RAV4 but the diagnosis remains the exact same with a u660E transmission. The trick I have found is
							to get a data list of the highlighted data you see in the picture below and you need to understand the difference between
							SLU and Lock-up parameters. The difference is Lock-up is the converter in full lock-up over 50MPH
							and SLU is the flex lock-up which is a duty-cycled (pulsed on and off) torque converter clutch
							solenoid parameter. The shudder found in TSB's is only occurring during flex lock-up, therefore, duplicate
							the shudder at 25-35mph when flex lock (SLU) turns ON.
						</blockquote>
						<img class="Data11" src="images/Torque Converter Shudder.png" alt="shudder occurring only when SLU is ON"></img>
						<blockquote>
							Start recording the test drive. Everytime you feel the shudder, hit the space bar to flag it. When you review
							your data it should look like the picture above. If you get to this point you should review my tech tips
							page first before replacing.

							Diagnosing Misfire From Carbon Build-up
						</h2>
						<hr>
						<blockquote>
							In the cases of very old Toyota engines with high mileage and a pretty severe lack of maintenance, or in the cases
							of the newer Yaris motors, carbon is going to become an issue. Toyota has been designing lower tension oil control
							rings and if you watch the humble mechanic on YouTube, you'll find out why this is such a big issue here. The basics of 
							it are this in my opinion: The engine is shut off and the presence of unburned fuel vapors condenses in a still humid environment
							and fuel droplets are pulled out of the air and settle on top of pistons and at the end of the injectors. After the 
							engine cools the fuel eventually turns into a sticky varnish and upon the next cold start an excessive amount
							of oil blows by the rings because they have low tension and gathers on the fuel varnish, gets hot and turns into carbon.
						</blockquote>
						<blockquote>
							If you diagnose this, my tip for you is to find out how you can track a misfire without the presence of fuel or spark.
							You can't very well do it by disabling any injectors with techstream or just doing a simple compression test because
							those won't be enough and sometimes that stuff is time consuming. What I do is monitor only the misfire counter for 
							each cylinder, the fuel trims, and fuel cut data parameters while recording my entire test drive to watch later. 
							I then get the car up to highway speeds and decelerate and see if when I replay my test drive, if the misfire happened at the
							same time as the fuel cut. If your fuel trim gets extremely positive, the carbon inside the motor is actually soaking 
							the fuel causing a slightly lean condition. MAF will possibly also drop during acceleration before you decel. 
							This is not foolproof but it is quick and easy to do while checking the vehicle for any pulls on a test drive.
