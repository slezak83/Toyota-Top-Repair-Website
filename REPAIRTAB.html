										Welcome to Repair. Here you will find many different repairs 
										available that were submitted from other Technicians the world over!
										These are the procedures you will find that make each job faster. They
										are based off of the Toyota Repair manuals, but the key is that they 
										have been custom tailored for max speed with the Technician in mind. 
										Just look to the left and you will find the menu for the repair 
										category. Click on one of the menu items such as "Engine" to find
										repair procedures for a job related to engine work. Submit any 
										questions or concerns to the webmaster found by going to "Contact Us"
