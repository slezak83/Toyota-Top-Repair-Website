							Tips and Tricks: Lower Control Arms
						</h3>
				<HR>
							<blockquote>
								The Toyota Highlander and Sienna's control arms have notoriously 
								weak bushings and I have found that they do tear quite frequently. 
								For any mechanic it is nice to know that they actually pay very well
								too, 6 hours worth for the Sienna's and 7 hours for the Highlander.
								Same applies to Lexus models RX400h, and RX330. In the next section
								below, I will give you inside information into how to complete this job
								quickly and beat the time without damaging the vehicle's axles, or 
								other parts.

								<h4 id="ControlArmTip">Trouble Areas of Note</h4>
<blockquote><br>It is helpful to Note that during this repair procedure there are serval areas where damage can occur: </blockquote>
<ul>
<li>	Axle Nut – It is incredibly helpful to note that during the removal of the control arms, if the technician removes or loosens the axle nut and attempts to reuse the nut, damage to the wheel bearing will occur. When removing axle nuts always use a small chisel or special service tool to release the stake at the end of the axle. Always replace axle nuts if they are removed. </li>
<li>	If lug nut sleeves are causing the 21 socket not to fit over the lug nut, use a 22 mm socket to get the lug nuts off and reorder new lug nuts.</li>
<li>	There is a flange sleeve that fits over the front 24mm bolt hole on the front mount of the lower control arms, do not put it onto the rear of the front control arm bushing or one of the 24 mm control arm bolts will not fit into the control arm.</li> 
<li>	When tightening the lower ball joints, make sure to tighten the bolt first, then tighten the nuts.</li>
<li>	After removing the lower ball joint from the control arms, lower the engine so that the drive axles inner joints relax and do not pull out on the joint. If it does
		it will pull the bearings apart inside and lengthen repair time.</li>

							Misfire Due to Carbon Build-up: 2016ish Yaris
						</H3>
						<hr>
						<blockquote>
							Check for TSB's, these Yaris' have a carbon build-up issue that causes a misfire. The misfire that I felt
							happened at idle, intermittently described like a "hiccup". Turning on the A/C doesn't really help to
							"stress" the engine because it is not ignition related, but results from a difference in compression/fuel mix
							from carbon sitting on the valves and tops of the pistons.
