										I have been a Automotive Technician for over 10 years now working for three different companies.
										I have worked for Pep Boys Auto, CarMax and Toyota. Originally from El Segundo, Ca, where I
										graduated High School, I always had an interest in "How Things Worked" and fixing my first
										car problem on my 1970 El Camino SS clone was a semi-euphoric experience. I had a manual choke that
										would not close and idle suffered asa result. The carburetor had a riser underneath making the 
										linkage connecting the choke to the bi-metal spring too short, so I bent it till I got enough lift.
										Never again did I suffer from stalling while warming up the car and it piqued my interest incredibly!

									<blockquote>
										I struggled diagnosing check engine lights at Pep Boys Auto in Westchester, Ca, but I still never
										gave up and eventually I started to get a better handle on things thanks to ScannerDanner.
										After spending 5 years at this shop, I decided it was time to move on and moved my tools down the 
										very same street all the way to CarMax. Now, here I spent a lot of time working on european and 
										other luxury vehicles. Surprisingly enough, the experience I took with me I was able to use heavily.
										I ended up diagnosing some fairly complex european cars and did things I never thought I could.
									</blockquote>
									
									<blockquote>
										At last I made it as a new hire with Toyota and I felt accomplished. But there was still so much to learn.
										I learned more about the products Toyota makes and how Toyota's process works. The learning curve for me 
										took about 3 months and afterwards I felt comforable. The specialized learning with any dealership is 
										much more in-depth, but every car manufacturer designs many of the same style components. Every car
										has a battery, fuel injectors, catalytic converters, etc. And I started to notice a lot of similaities.
										And so I began to collect tips I would get from other techs and ones I said to myself while I remembered
										how I repaired a vehicle with a similar problem and the information I recalled enabled me to complete
										the job much faster than before. This is when I started feeling like there needed to be a resource 
										that everyone should be able to access with these tips so new techs don't have to struggle as long
										and end up becoming more efficient in the long-run. And thus, Toyota Top Repair was born!
