								DIAGNOSTICS

									<blockquote>
										Diagnosis is a skill that can only become acquired by many years of practice. The technicians of
										today do not all have the same diagnostic skills that this job requires. The older technicians that
										spent years honing those skills are all gone. If you take training classes or research the 
										information on your own in order to obtain these skills, it could take a lot longer for a technician 
										to get up to speed on these skills. So what do we do about it? The goal of this area on Toyota Top 
										Repair is to take you through the process it takes to come up with a diagnosis, but more 
										importantly to hand you the information and proven skillsets that help to complete a diagnosis faster. 
										If it does not make sense to you by text the hope is that other things such as pictures and videos will.
										The idea is that by seeing how it is done and then actually doing it, you will learn quicker as well as
										retain the information that you are given here. And thats the key. Retention. A link to what tools you
										need will be provided in the future once the information becomes available.

			Paul Danner is one highly skilled diagnostician and Rosedale Tech Teacher, going by the name ScannerDanner on YouTube. He utilizes many different 
			ways of diagnosing codes as well as symptoms. Heavy use of oscilliscopes, keen observance and years
			of experience that you just can't substitute anything for! He also has a book out which is provided
			on his website. I HIGHLY recommend you check out his case studies and other diagnostic videos on his YouTube
			page! If not for how to use diagnostic tools, it's worth it to see his approach to diagnosis and explaination.

			<blockquote class="etcg"><img class="photo2" src="images/ETCG.png" alt="Eric The Car Guy"></img>Eric The Car Guy has been around for quite awhile and maintains a "backyard" mechanic approach where, he has 
			picked up on observance, a very good memory and also a vast library of experience that he can pull information
			from for common repairs. He can use the "backyard" mechanic approach that does not require a large toolbox
			filled with very expensive tools and can be used for diagnosis based on symptoms alone. Useful for quick diagnostic information
			when you're in a time crunch and need a quick answer or collecting symptoms for diagnosis.
